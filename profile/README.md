# Read-only mirror for https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/

This GitHub organisation contains read-only mirrors of projects in
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/, for two purposes:
- Discoverability: GitHub is popular, people are likely to be searching
  for projects here.
- Organisation: people using GitHub can fork repos here instead of
  making independent repositories, which allows all the forks to be
  under the same umbrella.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome, but please submit them to the upstream
repository, as any pull-request to the read-only mirrors will be closed.

Please read the GitHub description of each repo for a link to its
corresponding upstream repository.
